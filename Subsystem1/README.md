# Optimisation for piping subsection

## OPTIMISATION
    To run the optimisation code for the piping subsystem, download subsytem1.m and run in MATLAB.
    To run different algorithms, comment and uncomment as directed in the file

## OPTIMUM PIPE CROSS SECTION SHAPE
    The document Best_pipe_Cross_section.m is a text walkthrough of why a circle is the optimum shape for a pipe in order to reduce fritction
    At the end of the file is a section that, once run, will display a graph showing how hydraulic diameter decreases as a the number of sides of the shape increases

## Piping Diagram
    "washing machine diagram.png" is an image showing the simplified layout of the piping inside a dishwasher water distribution system
