# DE-4 Optimisation: Optimsing the environmental impact of a dishwasher
Christopher Turner, Francesca Suer, Seung Huh, Visakan Mathivannan

This repository contains the teams project work for solving an optimisation problem. You can find a copy of our final report alongside code for each individual subsystem and for the system level problem

The dishwasher could be broken down into a series of components each subsystem chosen was designed to optimise the transfer of either heat or pressure and they were as follows:
* Piping
* Heating element
* Pump
* Spray mechanism

The  project was completed entirely using MATLAB with some addition toolboxes which are required to run these programs.

* [Global Optimization Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/global-optimization.html)
