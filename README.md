# DE-4 Optimisation: Optimsing the environmental impact of a dishwasher
Christopher Turner, Francesca Suer, Seung Huh, Visakan Mathivannan

This repository contains the teams project work for solving an optimisation problem. You can find a copy of our final report alongside code for each individual subsystem and for the system level problem

The dishwasher could be broken down into a series of components each subsystem chosen was designed to optimise the transfer of either heat or pressure and they were as follows:
* Piping
* Heating element
* Pump
* Spray mechanism

The  project was completed entirely using MATLAB with some addition toolboxes which are required to run these programs.

* [Deep Learning Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html?s_tid=AO_PR_info)
* [Global Optimization Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/global-optimization.html)
## System Level
This combines subsystem 1,2 and 3 to find the monetary cost value over the dishwashers lifetime. Subsystem 4 has been ommited because its contributions are negliable.
### How to run
Run the system_level.m file with system_level_cons.m and system_level_cons2.m open.
### Summary
The system is optimised in terms of cost.
## Sub system 1 - Piping
intro here
### How to run
Run the Main.m file 
### Summary
Pipes are optimised
## Sub system 2 - Heating element
This subsystem optimises heat flux (a measure of watts per square meter) for the heating element.
### How to run
Run the Subsystem_2.m file with cons2.m, cons3.m, cons4.m and cons5.m open
### Summary
The heating element design is optimised
## Sub system 3 - Pump
intro here
### How to run
Run the Main.m file 
### Summary
Pipes are optimised
## Sub system 4 - Spray mechanism
intro here
### How to run
Run the Main.m file 
### Summary
Pipes are optimised
